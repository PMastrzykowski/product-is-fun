                                to talk to me if you need someone conducting
                                software development or bonding business and
                                technology. Here’s why:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a visionary thinker I can clearly imagine not
                                only how things will look in the future, but
                                also how to gradually change the current state
                                to achieve the goal. My imagination combined
                                with business, technical and design skills allow
                                me build things so quickly and so easily. Please
                                check the projects I have conducted so far. I
                                will be more than happy to tell you more about
                                the ways I work.

                                Being comfortable taking charge and speaking up
                                helps me remove bottlenecks and reassure others
                                in times of crisis. I am fully determined to
                                make a difference. This skill is extremely
                                important while working with a team - I break
                                the ice between the people naturally and make
                                them feel good with unfamiliar ones. While
                                living in three countries I mastered building
                                social connections from scratch.

                                I have a heavy load of experience in the direct
                                contact with all the variety of clients,
                                including the most difficult ones. I know how to
                                deal with people, make them happy and not let
                                them dominate me. In some projects I worked in
                                international cross-institutional teams with,
                                among others, Polish Ministry of Finance or the

Aby zapewnić odbiorcom możliwie najlepsze doznania akustyczne, pragniemy, aby sprzęt ten był wysokiej jakości. Nie chodzi nam o{'\u00A0'}pełne nagłośnienie sceniczne, tylko o{'\u00A0'}dobre kolumny aktywne, które będą energooszczędne i{'\u00A0'}łatwe w transporcie. Dla zapewnienia mobilności i{'\u00A0'}organizacyjnej niezależności, potrzebny prąd będziemy musieli magazynować w{'\u00A0'}uprzednio przygotowanym pojeździe. Teatr, to{'\u00A0'}również tworzące nastrój oświetlenie, dlatego nie{'\u00A0'}możemy go pominąć w{'\u00A0'}tym zestawieniu. Ważnym wyzwaniem finansowym będzie zakup stosownych kostiumów oraz prostej, mobilnej scenografii, a{'\u00A0'}także dobrej jakości pianina cyfrowego z{'\u00A0'}ważoną klawiaturą.
